# StopTheRepostingLicence

Hello this is the StopTheRepostingLicence it adds a band aid solution to the Minecraft Reposting problem in the Minecraft modding community Just copy paste the LICENSE.txt file into whatever website you want to and bam I makes it very hard to report the mod.This Project was inspired by MMPLv2 and no this is not meant to be a continuation of the Original License if you want to use the original use the original because I will not continue that License. and thanks to Stop mod reposts for providing the lists<br>
<br>
if you would like to know more visit https://stopmodreposts.org/ and support them <br>
or [ visit a blog i made about repost sites](https://brandonmohammed666blogs.wordpress.com/2022/02/03/the-issue-with-repost-sites-like-9minecraft/)

Credits:
-MMPLV2 = the idea for the project <br>
-StopModReposts = for providing the list<br>

this will not/is not intended to be a replacement to:
- MMPLv2<br>
- MIT<br>
- BDS<br>
- GPL<br>
etc.<br>

This is a wip rn currently I am trying to make it less of a crayon license and make things more Fair 

# Contributing 
Anyone is free to contribute to the License.
If you would like to contribute go to the dev branch no the main one as that one will be more stable and with less Wip ideas that could be bad for Cort

It is recommended to use the .txt version instead of the .MD version because that is updated less often.
all of the Licence text is under:<br>
[unlicense](https://unlicense.org/)


As of now this has not been checked by any lawyer to see if this is good for Cort but brandonbr1 will try to get one.

Authors Note: you can modify the licence text to fit you better
